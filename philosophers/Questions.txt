MANDATORY:

- Should the philosphers stop eating when they ate number_of_times_a_philo_should_eat times or should they continue eating until everyone has at least this number ?
- When there is a high number of philosophers, the creation of threads is not in sync, is that ok ?
- I have sometimes neighbor philosophers that take their own fork at the same time and stay in a state of locked forks because they can't take the other ones fork but it only happens with valgrind so should I take care of it ?
- If I have an action that happens at the same time as a philosopher dies, can I print it after I print that the philosopher died ?

BONUS:

- HOW TO KILL MY PROCESSES !!!!!???!??!?!?
